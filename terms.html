If you decide not to choose any alternative jewellery we shall refund you the amounts paid to us, if any for the specified order.
Diamond/gemstone prices vary from one category to another and seller to seller where numerous factors like reputation of the sellers, brand value, design of the jewellery and other factors have an impact on the price of the diamond/gemstone. The demand and supply of diamonds/gemstones in the market can also affect their price. The prices stated on the Website and/or App may be substantially higher or lower than the actual prices in the retail markets.
All pricing information available on the Website and/or App must be used as a general guideline for diamond and gemstone prices. While this Website and/or App is designed to provide the most accurate pricing information, the information about the diamonds/gemstones does not provide an appraisal or guarantee of value, nor does it give suggestions or recommendation of any sort for buying or selling diamonds/gemstones. All grading and pricing are subjective methods of analysis and no guarantee is made or liability assumed as to the accuracy or validity of the information provided by the service or the expertise of those providing information via the service.
