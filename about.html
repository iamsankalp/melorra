<h1>Melorra makes fine jewellery, fashionable.</h1>
<div class="rule"></div>
The brand Melorra was born to address the needs of the young urban Indian woman and her lifestyle. We recognise that today our consumer’s wardrobe is predominantly Western and trend driven. However, her fine jewellery choices are limited to traditional and heavy designs, leading to situational mismatches. <br />Melorra derives its design inspiration from global fashion trends, and creates designs relevant for everyday occasions. Melorra helps you accessorise right with your everyday attire.

<h2>Fashion Trend-Inspired Jewellery </h2>
Melorra is the first jewellery brand to create fine jewellery inspired by global fashion runway trends. Our expert global trend-spotters identify those trends that are likely to make it to the Indian fashion space, ahead of every season – spring-summer and autumn-winter – and bring it to our consumers at a really fast pace. 

<h2>Melorra Jewellery Design Approach </h2>      
All our designs are exclusive to us and are the result of our fashion trend analysis and interpretation. We have our own design studio, led by experienced designers based in India, the UK and the US. 

<h2>Melorra 14kt Gold Global Approach</h2>
Melorra uses 14kt gold for all its jewellery. In most of the fashion capitals of the world, jewellery is set in 14kt gold. It has the added advantage of weathering every day wear better and feels lighter to wear, making it suitable for everyday wear. 

<h2>Melorra Jewellery Design</h2>
Melorra makes every effort to make jewellery enjoyable to wear. Our earrings do not have threaded screws which are painful and difficult to put on. All our finger rings have the comfort fit feature. Many of our designs are modular, making them more versatile for different occasions.

<h2>Melorra Pricing</h2>
Melorra’s vision is to make fine jewellery so affordable as to make shopping a delightful experience. We offer some of the lowest pricing for diamonds while offering industry standard quality of S-I clarity and I-J color diamonds.

   <h2>The Melorra Shopping Experience </h2>
    
Melorra is available as an app both on iOS and Android platforms, along with a mobile responsive e-commerce enabled website. The Melorra app is designed by the best user experience designers of India, and is credited with editorial style images shot by India’s top fashion photographers and featuring the most sought-after supermodels. 



<h2>The Melorra Stylefeed TM</h2>

The StylefeedTM is Melorra's proprietary style guidance which inspires you to put together a complete look which constitutes global trend-based clothing and accessories (shoes, bags) along with Melorra jewellery designed specifically for that trend. This guidance is spread across three user occasions: Work, Party and Casual. The guidance is aimed at keeping you abreast with the current global fashion trends and to associate jewellery in a fashion context.<br />
The Stylefeed™ forms the primary buying tool for the Melorra app and website.

<h2>Melorra Diamonds </h2>

        The diamonds for Melorra’s jewellery designs are ethically sourced and conflict free. Our diamonds are <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/">Kimberly Process</a> compliant and all our jewellery pieces are accompanied by diamond certificates issued by <a href="http://www.igiworldwide.com/jewelry.html">IGI Laboratories</a>, India’s foremost diamond authority. 

<h2>Melorra Gemstones </h2>

Melorra beats to the pulse of fashion and many of our contemporary jewellery creations feature gemstones that are in sync with the fashion colors of the latest season. <br />We do not limit our designers to the use of the traditional four precious gemstones – ruby, sapphire, emerald and aquamarine, but give them access to the entire palette of colors in the world of semi-precious gemstones; this includes cultured and freshwater pearls. 
 



<h2>Melorra Quality Standards</h2>
 
Melorra jewellery designs are fabricated through a network of India’s leading and technically advanced jewellery manufacturers, who have partnered with us to deliver current and original jewellery creations. <br />All Melorra jewellery designs also undergo careful inspection by our in-house quality assurance team, who verify all technical performance aspects of findings and clasps before the jewellery is dispatched. Melorra jewellery is manufactured in 14kt gold, available in all three prevalent gold colors – yellow, white and rose gold. Many designs are enhanced with premium surface plating applications that provide improved hardness and wear resistance.

<h2>Melorra Certification </h2>

All our jewellery creations are best in class in terms of gemstone quality and gold purity. These important product quality aspects are certified by independent and respected certification agencies like IGI, SGL and BIS; these are well-known certification labs and government agencies.


<h2>Melorra Shipping</h2>

Delivering your product safely to you is our top priority. Our products are packed in special Melorra boxes which keep the jewellery safe from damage. The box also comes with tamper-evident packaging. We urge you not to accept the package if you think it has been tampered with, and inform us so that we can take action.

<h2>Melorra Social Cause Support </h2>

All of us who are privileged to buy great clothes and jewellery do also wish to support less fortunate women and girls. With a female founder at the helm, all of us at Melorra are very passionate about girl child education and feel that for India’s progress, educating India’s female children is imperative. <br />Melorra proudly supports the incredible work by “Educate Girls” a not-for-profit organisation in Rajasthan, a state which has one of the worst ratios of girl child education. Featured on the global girlrising.com platform, “Educate Girls” has so far helped in the education of 100,000 girls. Melorra makes a humble contribution of ₹100 from the profit of every sale. So, as our customer you can not only be proud of wearing Melorra but also feel good that your purchase has helped educate girl children in some of the poorest districts of India.
