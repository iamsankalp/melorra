<h2>Our Security and Storage Procedures for Your Data</h2>

At August Jewellery, we make the protection of your personal information from loss, theft or misuse our top priority. All the information we collect is stored using the same security measures that we use to protect our own proprietary corporate data. Only authorised users are able to access the data we collect and store. 

At times we may collect Non-Personal Information (NPI) via our service, including but not limited to your IP host address, the date, time, and time zone of the ad request, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, and your computer’s operating system. If necessary, we retain this NPI at a user level for a certain period in order to ensure that our service is functioning properly. We may also retain data at an aggregated level – so that no individual user, albeit anonymous, could be picked out from the data – indefinitely for purposes of reporting and system analytics. 
 
<h2>Information Sharing</h2>

Unless otherwise permitted by you, we will not share even your NPI with third parties. However, we might be under the obligation to share this information with the following third parties and in the following circumstances: (i) to the appropriate authorities when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person; (ii) to a court of law, arbitration panel, or similar body to enforce or protect our rights either under law or as granted by an agreement; (iii) to the company or entity that acquires all or substantially all of our assets, including if the acquisition occurs as the result of our bankruptcy; or (iv) to third parties that help us provide the Service to Clients, or that enter into strategic partnerships with the company which allow us to expand the Service for our Clients.

Please be aware that we have not designed this website for, and do not intend it to be used by anyone under the age of 18.

Should we inadvertently acquire personal information or other data from users under the age of 18, we will not knowingly provide this data to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, and any subsequent disclosure would be due to the fact the user under age 18 used our website and submitted personal information without solicitation by or permission from us.
